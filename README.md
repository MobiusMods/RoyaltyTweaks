Limits throne room requirement to highest ranking royal. Also re-enables passionate skills.

Royalty Tweaks 1.21

What noble in their right mind would let their knights each have their own throne room? Not mine, that's for sure!

This mod removes the demand by nobles other than the highest ranking in your colony to have a throne room. You can still give them one if you like but it's entirely optional.

Conceited royals (greedy and/or jealous) are also a little less lazy now that they remember how much they used to like to do the... things they liked to do... before the mysterious brain implants. They will continue to work their passionate skills even after ranking up.

FEATURES
THRONE ROOM
The only royal who will have need of a throne room and the Authority need that goes with it is the royal with the highest title who lives on the same map.
If they are married to another royal, their spouse can also have need of a throne room and authority need if their title demands it. This option can be changed in the option menu.
If there is a tie for loftiest title regardless of relationship, both will demand throne rooms until you give one to one of them.

SKILLS
Conceited royals will now continue to work their previously title-disabled passionate skills. This feature can be turned off in the options menu if desired.

CONFLICTS
None! (Hopefully)

FAQ
Q. Can this be installed in a pre-existing game/save?

CHANGELOG
1.21 - Fixed compatibility with traits disabled through genes (Thanks, TheCakeMachine!)

1.2 - Fixed DLL to work with Rimworld 1.5

1.19 - Fixed DLL issues. (Sorry, folks!)

1.18 - Upgraded to 1.4 game version support.

1.17 - Upgraded to 1.3 game version support.
Support for multiple spouses (I hope).

1.16 - Removed Inspiration from Inspiring Speech stuff because it's been added to the core Royalty experience. Updated the mod to not throw warnings about game version 1.2.

1.15 - The second highest royal will no longer demand a throneroom when the highest one gets sent on a caravan or goes out trading or something. It should now work as expected. Thanks to Delmar for reporting that bug.

1.14 - Progress marches on. I removed the authority stuff since it's been removed from the game itself. I did some code cleanup on some renamed methods as well.

1.13 - Authority need decay rate is now adjustable. You can make your royals spend less time in the throne room if you like.

1.12 - Inspirational speeches can trigger skill inspiration in listeners.

1.11 - Removed shared throne room stuff because it's now in the vanilla game.

1.10 - * Option to allow all nobles to share a single throne room.

* Attempted to address issues some people have with saving settings.

1.09 - * Updated to support conceited royals.

* Addressed Incapable List bug.

1.08 - * If there is more than one royal with the highest title, the others will stop demanding a throne room when you assign a throne to one of them.

* Added Chinese translations to the options menu.

* Attempted to limit the mod logic to prevent strange behavior in other circumstances.

1.07a - Throne Room adjustments are now optional and controlled in the options menu. Made minor changes to try and make the mod settings turned on by default.

1.06 - Resolved Work Tab incompatibility

1.05 - You can toggle if you'd like to re-enable all passionate skills or just major ones in the options menu.

1.04 - Saved skill priority settings now properly loading for passion skills.

1.03 - * Royals will now continue to work their passionate skills.
* Fixed spousal throne room desire to be true for new installs. If a spouse isn't demanding a throneroom and you wondered why, this is why. It defaulted to false previously and erroneously. You can always toggle it either way in the mod options (now plural!) menu.

1.02 - Spouse throne room desire can now be changed via an options menu checkbox.

1.01 - You can now assign lower title pawns to their own throne rooms and reestablish their Authority need/work but also get the mood bonuses for having a throne room. Also speeches... because who doesn't love listening to a really great speech? Maybe during a heat wave... cozying up to some burning braziers while standing next to a cannibal wearing a raider hat.

1.00 - Initial Release

(This is my first time ever publishing a mod so any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks for looking!)
